# Welcome to my Gemini page!
A friend of mine introduced me to this and it's really neat! So I'm gonna have
lots of fun tinkering with this. (Hi Mallow! <3)

My favorite things:
* Mallow
=> gemini://tsuntsun.cities.yesterweb.org/ Check her site out!
* Cuties (See Above)

# About This Site
### What the heck is that name?
My domain is meant to be read as one word: gogobebe. It's a reference to a KPop
song by the girl group MAMAMOO. It's title being... "gogobebe" (I highly
recommend it!) I usually pronounce my domain just as it's said in the song.

### What does it run on?
The 'machine' and OS is a cloud instance running Ubuntu 21.10. I went with
molly-brown as my Gemini server because it was recommended by others. It's the
only one I've used, but so far it's working well enough. (Fingers crossed!)
