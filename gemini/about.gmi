# Bio
Hello there! My name's Joe, and online I go by Doge(OfDisaster). I am a
3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student.

# Hobbies
Two of my biggest interests revolve around the computer: programming and video
games. Some games I enjoy playing:
* Team Fortress 2
* Minecraft
* Slime Rancher
* Stardew Valley
* Portal 2
* ...and many more!

The rest of my time, I'm usually coding (and doing other Computer Science
related things. Right now, I mostly just have one main project: a Discord bot
called COLOR*IZ. In brief, it allows regular users to assign their own custom
colors - without needing an admin to make dedicated color roles beforehand.
