** Notes
   Using active dry yeast instead of instant dry yeast. We're activating the
   yeast in the 1.5 cups of warm water (120 F, put in microwave for 30 s on
   high) with 2.25 tsp of yeast and 1 tsp of sugar. We waited for the yeast to
   bubble, which took 7 minutes. The dry was whisked together, and the yeast,
   water, and 2 T of oil was added.

** Copy of Their Recipe
   Makes two 14-inch pizzas (615.75 in^2 of dough)
*** Dough
   1 package of yeast
   1 cup water
   1 heaping tablespoon sugar
   3 tablespoons softened butter
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
   2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
   1. Measure one cup of cold water and then heat it to 110-115 degrees. This
      takes 45 seconds â€“ 1 minute in the microwave and I check the temp with a
      meat thermometer.
   2. Pour the water in a large mixing bowl and add the package of yeast and the
      sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
   3. Mix in the butter, salt, and flour and knead until the dough is smooth
      (3-5 min.)
   4. Cover a bowl in olive oil spray, put the dough in it, cover with a towel,
      and let it rise in a place protected from drafts for about an hour.
   5. Punch it down and let it rise again.
   6. Roll it out evenly on a 14-inch pan (coated with olive oil) or a pizza
      peel (coated with flour).
** Our Recipe
   Multiply their recipe by 1.06 (sorta)
   7.5 g yeast
   >=1 cup water
   2 tablespoon sugar
   3 1/3 tablespoons softened butter
   1 2/3 teaspoons salt
   2 2/3 cups bread flour
** Notes
   - We're using mozzarella and parmesan, not provolone
   - We're using unsalted butter (the recipe did not specify)
   - We prebaked the crust at 450 F for ~5 minutes
     - It shrunk, so we rolled it out on the cutting board until it was closer
       to the edge of the pan
