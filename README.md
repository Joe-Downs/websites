# gogobe.be
This is the git repo for my website, [gogobe.be](https://gogobe.be/). On it, I
want to put a little bit about myself, my projects, and my hobbies. At the
moment, I am planning on digitizing some recipes I have. Perhaps I will also add
a blog of sorts where I can write down my thoughts / share intersting things I'm
working on.
